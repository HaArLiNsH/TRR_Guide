TRR_Guide 
=======


TRR_Guide is a collection of textures made to be used as example with [TextureReplacerReplaced](https://github.com/HaArLiNsH/TextureReplacerReplaced)

All of these textures are made in a bigger format than the old textures used in TextureReplacer. The originals size for these textures was usually 1024x1024, but we aren't in the middle age anymore, we can use textures sized 4096x4096 :) 

ENJOY HD TEXTURES !  

And expect lots of changes here as TRR continue to grow :)

**************************** Name Convention ****************************

Here is the new name convention that you need to use in your suit pack to use all the new features from TRR :

All these files goes from level 0 to level 5 as this : 

	Helmet_EvaGround_Badass_Female0
	Helmet_EvaGround_Badass_Female1
	Helmet_EvaGround_Badass_Female2
	Helmet_EvaGround_Badass_Female3
	Helmet_EvaGround_Badass_Female4
	Helmet_EvaGround_Badass_Female5

Doing HD texture can quickly goes crazy in term of memory weight and you need to make compromise.
My advice for the sizes of your HD texture set is to use differents sizes for the elements (this is the TRR_Guide MIXED suit set)

Helmet : 2048x2048
Jetpack : 2048x2048
Suit : 4096x4096
visor : 1024x1024


You can go for bigger but here is some number to help you understand what I mean : 


- Full set in 4096x4096 : 18Go
- Full set in 2048x2048 : 4.5Go
- Full set in 1024x1024 : 1.12Go

- Full set in mixed sizes : 6.75Go

Off course you will NEVER make a full suit set with the 1056 files :) 

Try to use the same NRM as much as possible! 
The levelled NRM exist mostly to have the capacity to make a different NRM for the level 5, not for all level. 


**************************** HOW TO MAKE A SUIT PACK ****************************

The number of files to make seems huge but ther are tricks to generate a lot of differents files with little differences from a single one. 

1 : You start by only making the Male version

2 : You only need one base texture for each state of each parts with a class icon and some color to identify the class (pilot, engineer, ... ). You can find the guide for the zones of the different textures in the TRR_guide files.
	
	Helmet IVA Male (can be the same as the EVA ground)
	Helmet EVA ground Male
	Helmet EVA space Male
	
	Jetpack EVA ground Male
	Jetpack EVA space Male
	
	Suit IVA Male
	Suit EVA ground Male (for me, this suit is a variation of the IVA, but where you see the gloves and the chest that hold the jetpack)
	Suit EVA space Male
	
	Visor IVA Male (can be the same as the EVA ground)
	Visor EVA ground Male
	Visor EVA space Male
	
3 : You make the female version of the parts you want to distinguish the gender. This is not mandatory for all the parts	exept these because the female mesh is different and you can see texture warping on the arms from the shoulder and also a difference on the butt 

	Suit IVA Female
	Suit EVA ground Female
	Suit EVA space Female
		
4 : You will make different layers to each elements to make each variations. this can be a color or some text. They need to be able to be merged on the same base element. They need to be as generic as possible, so if you make color, use it for each class like the orange for the veteran state. 

!!!!!   If you want to lower the number of NRM needed, try to differentiate only by making a change in color. If you make a patch or some text, you will need a NRM for each.  !!!!!! 
	
	standard (nothing here normally)
	badass (maybe a patch or a color line)
	veteran (the iconical orange color variation, need to see both the veteran color and the base class color)	
	
	veteran + badass (normaly you should be able to use the veteran and the badass layer to make this one, but in some case you want to make a different texture , for example, in my pack, Val is a veteran badass and she will have a pink color instead of the orange for the veteran badass state)
	
5 : You will make layers for the levels of each elements you want to level.	This can be color variation on the base suit and/or text that indicate the level. They need to be as generic as possible, so if you make color, use the color of your class. 

!!!!!   If you want to lower the number of NRM needed, try to differentiate only by making a change in color. If you make a patch or some text, you will need a NRM for each.  !!!!!!

	level 0
	level 1
	level 2
	level 3
	level 4
	level 5 
	
6 : The fun part begin, listen to some good and chill music, avoid distractions (wife, children, crazy cat, ... ) and export in .png each part with all states and variations one by one, level after level :) 

!!! export in .png Uncompressed !!! 

Put all the files in the same directory except the visors 

7 : Now generate all the normal Maps (NRM) you need from these png and save them also in .png uncompressed if you can. 

put all these NRM in a different folder than the others

8 : Batch invert vertically all these files. Don't overwrite them !! you never know if you are going to need them again.   
	
I used GIMP2 + the BIMP plugin (see the usefull tools part)
	
9 : Batch convert in NRM all these files as this (I used DDS converter ) : 
	
	- Use dxt1 with "Mipmaps" checked for the helmet, jetpack and suit
	
	- Use dxt5 with "Mipmaps" and "alpha" checked for the visor 
	
	- Use dxt5NormalMap with "Mipmaps", "Normal" and "toNormalMap" checked for the NRM
	
	
	
****************************  Usefull tools :  ****************************

- [NormalMap-Online](http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/)
Online tool for generating Normal, Displacement, Ambient Occlusion and Specular maps 

- [KSP to DDS texture converter](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/88972-win-ksp-to-dds-texture-converter/ )
A great and simple tool to convert your .png to .dds 
Use dxt1 for normal textures without alpha and dxt5 for NRM.(windows only)
(the next one is even better)

- [DDS converter](https://vvvv.org/contribution/dds-converter)
A really great converter that Convert JPG,TGA,PNG to DDS using NVIDIA Texture Tools 2.0 with CUDA Acceleration.
This is the batch converter I used to make to TRR_Guide suit set 
 
- [GIMP 2](https://www.gimp.org/fr/) + [BIMP. Batch Image Manipulation Plugin.](http://registry.gimp.org/node/26259)
To batch modify your texture file , like the invert you need to do before converting .png to .dds or to batch resize
